# Planting Life
Planting Life is a web application designed to make it simple to discover native plants that will thrive based on 
location, sunlight, and moisture.  The project's mission is to make this simple in order to encourage decisions 
which help the ecosystem.  It's hosted at https://planting.life.

## Why?
Native plants can be eaten by local insects, which can be eaten by local birds, which leads to a thriving ecosystem.  
Non-native plants often (though not always) lack these benefits.


## How does it work?
The suggested plants and their images come from [planting-life-data](https://github.com/developing-human/planting-life-data), but in short
it uses expert data (USDA & similar) as much as possible and fills in the blanks with LLM output.
